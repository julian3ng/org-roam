#+title: CL Compile Time
* When is compile time?
  - Compile time happens before load time, which is before run time.
    Evaluating code at compile time is needed to make functions
    available for use in macros that get used at top level. We use
    =eval-when= with =:compile-toplevel= at the top level to make this
    happen. [[id:fbd1ce82-26b2-4c75-b636-222c4143ad8e][Eval-when is kind of confusing]], so we'll look at it more.

    For example:

    #+begin_src lisp
      (eval-when (:compile-toplevel) ;; Only does something at compile time
        (defun run-at-compile-time ()
          (print "COMPILE TIME"))) ;; Recompile with C-c C-c to update

      (defmacro foo ()
        (run-at-compile-time)
        '(print "RUN TIME"))

      (foo)
    #+end_src
    
* How do the different times differ?
  - Compile time happens during... compilation to machine-specific
    code? (C-c C-c in lisp buffer)
  - Load time (doesn't happen when (load) is called for whatever reason?)
  - Eval time happens at actual run time

** TODO What is load time really??
