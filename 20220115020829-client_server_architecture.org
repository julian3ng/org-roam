#+title: Client/Server Architecture
* Client
  The *client* is the user-facing part of the application. It provides the
  interface through which the user sends commands to the server. Having the
  client separated out from the server allows the existence of other types of
  clients. For example, in the case of databases, there might be a GUI client
  and a CLI client to the same database server.
  
* Server
  The *server* does the actual processing for an application. It needs to
  provide some API for interaction that the client can use.

* Architecture
  An application may have more than one layer of client-server interactions. A
  client could query a server, which might query another server, and so on.
