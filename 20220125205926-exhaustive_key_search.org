#+title: Exhaustive Key Search
* Exhaustive Key Search
  Given a block cipher $E: \{0,1\}^k \times \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^n$, given a
  bunch of message/ciphertext pairs, we can brute force the key as follows:

  #+begin_src text
    for i = 1 ... 2^k:
        K_i = <n-bit representation of i>
        # (M_i, C_i) is the ith known pair of message/ciphertexts
        if all(E(K_i, M_i) = C_i):
            return K_i
  #+end_src

  At worst, this takes $2^k$ block cipher computations. On average, this takes
  $2^{k-1}$ such computations.
