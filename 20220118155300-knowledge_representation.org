#+title: Knowledge Representation
* Knowledge Representation
  Knowledge Representation (KR) aims to create an ontology (a way of describing
  existence) of the domain of knowledge, mapping out concepts and their
  relationships. Compared to other high-level conceptual data models, KR works
  in a broader domain.

  KR includes Reasoning mechanisms to make inferences from existing knowledge,
  and is more flexible than other models, at the cost of efficiency.
