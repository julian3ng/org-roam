#+title: Block Cipher Modes of Operation
* Modes of Operation
  A mode of operation takes a block cipher, which can encrypt and decrypt a
  single block, and gives a way to encrypt and decrypt longer messages.

  Notation: $M[i]$ denotes block $i$ of the message, and $C[i]$ denotes block
  $i$ of the ciphertext.
  
** Electronic Code Book (ECB)
   $C[i] = E_K(M[i])$

   - Not at all secure. The same block will encode to the same block
     later. This motivates other modes of operation.

** Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
   - With random IV (initial vector):
     - Encryption: \(IV \xleftarrow{\$} \{0, 1\}^n\) (treat $IV$ as $C[0]$)

       $C[i] \gets E_K(M[i] \oplus C[i-1])$

     - Decryption:

       $M[i] = E^{-1}_K(C[i]) \oplus C[i-1]$

   - Stateful CBC with counter IV:
     - Instead of initializing $IV$ randomly, start it at $0^n$ and increment
       it for every message.

** Randomized Counter Mode (CTR$)
   - Let $F: \{0, 1\}^k \times \{0, 1\}^l \rightarrow \{0, 1\}^l$ be a function
     family with no particular properties.
   - \(CTR\$ = (\{0, 1\}^k, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{D})\)
   - Encryption:

     \(R \xleftarrow{\$} \{0, 1\}^l\)

     $C[i] \gets F_K(R+i) \oplus M[i]$
   - Decryption:

     $M[i] \gets F_K(R+i) \oplus C[i]$

   - Note that we don't care about the inverse of $F$ because we always xor
     after applying $F$ to the random state.

   - Similarly to Stateful CBC, we can have Stateful Counter Mode (CTRC) by
     setting $R = 0$ and just continuing with the current counter after every
     message.

** Table of Security
   | Mode | IND-CPA? | IND-CCA? |
   |------+----------+----------|
   | ECB  | No       | No       |
   | CBCC | No       | No       |
   | CBC$ | Yes      | No       |
   | CTRC | Yes      | No       |
   | CTR$ | Yes      | No       |
