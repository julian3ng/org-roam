#+title: Cybercrime
* Cybercrime: The Actors
  - Exploit Devs: make the exploits, reverse engineer software
  - Botnet Masters: develop software and control botnets for hire
  - Spammers: Advertise links for other actors
  - Phishers: Set up phishing sites, work with spammers to spread evil sites
  - Counterfeiters: Sell fake goods, get money from legit credit cards
  - Bulletproof hosting providers: Offer dedicated servers for evil
  - Carders, Cashiers, Mules: Turn stolen bank accounts and credit cards to cash
  - Crowdturfers: creates, verify, and manage fake accounts. Solve CAPTCHAs for
    money.
* Structure
  - Botnets are used for everything - spam, bitcoin mining, DDOS, account theft,
    etc.
  - Spam is used by phishers, counterfeiters, and malware to spread exploits and
    gain money
  - Carders and cashiers get this money into a usable state.
* Exploit as a service
  - Decouples monetization and compromise
  - Exploit devs sell their exploits
  - Other actors use these to attack hosts
  - Compromised hosts are then sold

  - Attackers can either buy the exploit and deploy it themselves, or rent an
    exploit server that hosts the exploit kit.

  - Attackers must direct traffic to exploit via phishing or spam themselves
  - Traffic Pay Per Install (PPI): Bundles traffic acquisition mechanism as well.
* Surface/Deep/Darkweb
  - Surface: indexed on search engines
  - Deep: NOT indexed on standard search engines
  - Dark: Content in the Deep Web
* Botnet Command and Control
** Centralized Control
   - Botnet master tells control servers to tell bots to send spam.
   - Efficient
   - Problem: single point of failure, easy to target
** P2P Botnet
   - Botnet master tells control servers to insert command into the distributed
     hash table
   - Bots read the command from the hash table and start sending spam
   - More robust, but no direct control over bots
** Fast Flux DNS
   - All bots connect to C&C website
     - This is efficient!
   - Website can be mapped to different IPs and moved to different servers
   - DNS to IP mapping can be changed
   - However: domain name can still be blocked by ISPs
** Random Domain Generation
   - Bots generate large number of random domain names every day
   - Botmaster knows the random domain names of the day because they use the
     same seed and algorithm
   - Botmaster registers only a few of the random names.
   - These sites can be used with fast flux to change IPs every 10s
* Spam
  - Irrelevant and/or inappropriate content with a large number of recipients
  - Send email for other actors for a fee
  - Used to spread phishing sites, acquire traffic for PPI, get emails
  - Spammers rent botnet access to send spam
  - Spam has low conversion rate due to spam filters
