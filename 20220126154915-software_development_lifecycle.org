#+title: Software Development Lifecycle
* SDLC
  The software development lifecycle describes the methods a team uses to create
  software. Agile and Waterfall are two different methodologies. Agile
  emphasizes short feedback loops via sprints, while Waterfall tackles projects
  in single-focus phases aimed at finishing one part of the process at a time.
  
** Waterfall
   The phases of waterfall are:

   1) Business process (re)design
   2) Analysis
   3) Specification
   4) Design
   5) Implementation
   6) Testing
   7) Operation
   8) Maintenance

   Steps 2-5 are handled differently in a database application, according to
   CS6400 (see [[id:2a4f0d3f-a7c5-425b-aa96-430115595e67][Database Application Development]])
