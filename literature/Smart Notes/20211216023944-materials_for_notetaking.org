#+title: Materials for Notetaking
* Keep it Simple!
  - Existing tools and workflows often get caught up in themselves and
    the focus becomes the act of notetaking, rather than the more
    important acts of thinking, learning, and synthesizing.
  - Thus, we need only four things:
    1) Writing apparatus: something to write with and something to
       write on (intended for your fleeting notes)
    2) Reference management system: something to collect your readings
    3) Slip box: org-roam
    4) Editor: emacs
