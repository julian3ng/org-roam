#+title: Zettelkasten, as originally used
* Niklas Luhmann's process
  - Originally, there were bibliographical notes and brief
    notes. Bibliographical notes would have the citation details and
    a short note of the content. Brief notes were where thoughts on
    the material were condensed and linked to other contexts.
  - Notes that follow others in some way would be directly behind
    and notated so via the id (not relevant due to org-roam)
  - !!! When adding a note, /review other notes/ to find places they
    should be linked !!!
    - This helps enforce the context of the ideas.
