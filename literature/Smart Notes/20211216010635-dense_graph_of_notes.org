#+title: Dense Graph of Notes
* Why do we want a dense graph of notes?
  - Having a dense graph of notes makes seeing connections across
    seemingly disparate topics easier. If we divide notes by
    predefined topics, subtopics, categories, etc., then we
    artificially enforce the divisions and stifle connections between
    them.
