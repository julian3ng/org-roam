#+title: Note Taking as a Tool of Thought
* Bibliographical Note: _How to Take Smart Notes_, SÃ¶nke Ahrens
* How this is different from the norm
  - This method differs from the norm - where the focus is on the
    final product, be it an essay, paper, article, or other such
    document - in that it focuses on the lead up to that point in the
    form of notes.
* Why focus on notes?
  - The notes themselves are important! Poor notetaking doesn't have
    immediate consequences, but will eventually bite you in the butt.
  - The quality of the final document depends on [[id:a90b9cb9-92f3-489d-b8c2-1170563194a0][What You've Already Written]]
* What is the goal of this method?
  - This notetaking method aims to build a base of interconnected
    notes. The connections between notes serve as context from which
    one can build ideas and glean insights.
  - Furthermore, it aims to provide a flexible /system/ of taking notes
    that makes it easy them easy to add and retrieve as new ideas
    come.
  - We want to have an external framework to think within.
* How does the system work?
  - Note ideas and index them
  - Connect notes that relate (be sure to note why when linking!)

  - We end up with a [[id:326f6520-f99b-44e9-8585-986ef0c705ba][Dense Graph of Notes]] as opposed to a hierarchical
    tree of notes separated by topics and categories.
  - The system perscribed in this book is a bit more
    involved. [[id:e4eca592-4f5c-4414-9e47-c3736938007a][Notetaking per The Book]]
  - We don't need a lot of materials for this. [[id:d7951caa-be15-47ab-bf47-9e815d501f45][Materials for
    Notetaking]]
  - There are [[id:bcc68246-ecc9-49b3-a681-97637a062491][four underlying principles]] that ensure the system
    facilitates learning and writing.
