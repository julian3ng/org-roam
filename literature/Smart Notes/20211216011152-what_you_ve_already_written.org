#+title: What You've Already Written
* The Writing Process
  - It's much easier to write a final document having a rough
    draft. All you have to do is some editing and polishing, and
    you're done.
  - Similarly, creating such a rough draft is easy with all the ideas,
    arguments, references, quotes, and other bits of data connected up
    and laid out for you in a proper order.
  - Assembling a rough draft based on your notes, which are easily
    connected due to the note taking process ([[id:f082a0b4-1a25-462f-b8be-c5d3910ea920][Note Taking as a Tool of
    Thought]]), is a simple task as well.
  - /And writing notes should happen as you read, think, and learn./
    - Notes should be in your own words; this helps you internalize
      what you're reading.
