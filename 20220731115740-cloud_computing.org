#+title: Cloud Computing
* Cloud Computing
  - We want to have a configurable shared pool of resources...
  - ... that we can rapidly provision with minimal effort 
* Models
  - SAAS: software is provided in the cloud
  - PAAS: software is written using languages and tools hosted in the cloud (the
    platform)
  - IAAS: Consumer gets ability to create storage, networks, and other resources
    from the cloud (infrastructure)
* Deployment models
  - Private: only for org
  - Community: supports a community with shared concerns, could be multiple orgs
  - Public: everyone can use it
  - Hybrid: two or more of the above
* NIST cloud definition framework
  - Hybrid clouds can be public/private/community and serve SAAS, PAAS, and IAAS
  - They have certain essential characteristics
    - On demand self service
    - Broad nw access
    - rapid elasticity
    - resource pooling
    - measured service
  - And often have these:
    - massive scale
    - resilient computing
    - homogeneity
    - geographic distribution
    - virtualization
    - service orientation
    - low cost software
    - advanced security
* Security concerns
  - Cloud computing is massively complex and therefore has many security
    concerns to address
  - How can we trust the cloud? How can we encrypt our data? How do we ensure
    the cloud provider complies?
** Advantages
   - Public data being in the cloud reduces access of systems that have private data
   - Cloud homogeneity makes audits easier
   - Automated security management
   - Redundancy and disaster recovery
** Disadvantages
   - Must trust the vendor's security model
   - Customers can't do anything about audit findings
   - Must petition vendor for support
   - Can't examine implementation
   - No physical control
* Cloud computing security summary
  Advantages
  - data fragmentation and dispersal
  - dedicated security team
  - greater security investment
  - fault tolerance and reliability
  - resliency
  - hypervisor protection against nw attacks
  - compliance analysis is easier
  - data held by unbiased party (according to the provider)
  - low cost disaster recovery
  - on demand security controls
  - real time tampering detection
  - rapid reconstitution of services


  Challenges
  - Data dispersal vs international privacy laws
  - isolation management requried
  - multi-tenancy
  - logging
  - data ownership
  - qos guarantees
  - dependence on secure hypervisors
  - high value target to hackers
  - securing virtual OSs in the cloud
  - massive outages can knock over internet
  - public vs private cloud security
  - public SAAS version control lacking
  -
