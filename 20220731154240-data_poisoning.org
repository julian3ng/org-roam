#+title: Data Poisoning
* Data Poisoning
  - Rise of ML in security creates rise in attempts to attack the training data
    of the model (data poisoning)
  - Other ways: try to find decision boundary of model and then craft payloads
    to evade (evasion attack)
* PAYL
  - Model made for each packet length (1gram frequencies)
  - Weird packet lengths are marked anomalies
  - Packets with weird frequencies are marked anomalies
  - Attackers can blend their attacks by changing byte frequency and length to
    match that of normal traffic
