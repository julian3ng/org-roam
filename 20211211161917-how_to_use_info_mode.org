#+title: How to use info mode
* Info mode quick tips!
  - h: help!
  - q: quit
** Basic Navigation
   - n, p: forwards/backwards at same level
   - SPC, BACKSPACE: up/down in page, can cross node boundaries,
     subnode first
   - ]/[: backwards/forwards regardless of level
** Menus and subnodes
   - m: pick from menu (children of this node)
     - TAB and M-TAB can be used to move around in menu as well
   - u: up from subnode
** Cross References
   - RET (on reference): go to reference
   - f: pick from node's references
   - TAB/M-TAB: move around cross references (outside of menu)
** History
   - l: backwards in history
   - r: forwards in history
   - L: show history in node
** Index
   - i: pick from index
   - d: go to directory
   - t: go to top
   - I: make node with result of index search
** Search
   - s: search through Info file
   - C-s: incremental search, WILL GO THROUGH NODE BOUNDARIES
   - C-r: backwards incsearch
** Advanced
   - g: goto node by name
     - '*' as filename will show the whole file
   - 1-9: goto menu item n
   - 0: last menu item
   - M-n: new info instance
   - C-u m: menu in new instance
   - C-u g: goto node by name in new instance
   - [[info:info#Emacs Info Variables][Variables]]: chances are I won't use this, but it's good to have on hand
