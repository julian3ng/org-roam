#+title: Botnet Detection
* Botnet Detection
  - In ancient times, attack traffic was obviously different from normal network
    traffic.
  - This isn't the case anymore, now there are packers, rootkits, etc. that can
    defeat antivirus
  - Mobile devices can be compromised outside of the corporate network
  - Bots evolve and can have flexible c&c architecture
  - Looking for one particular signature of an attack is unlikely to work anymore
* Correlation
  - To detect a bot, we can use two types of correlation
  - Vertical (time axis): check if bot has similar repeating actions over time
  - Horizontal (machine axis): check if multiple machines has same actions
    simultaneously
  - BotHunter uses vertical correlation to ID bot lifecycle events
  - BotMiner: botnets can have different lifecycles, which can evade BotHunter.
    Therefore, we need both vertical and horizontal correlation to sniff out
    correlated bots
  - C plane clustering: communications over time - evade with noise, c&c command
    changes
  - A plane clustering: similar activities between bots - evade with disguised
    activities like slow spam and legit emails with spam links
* DNS behavior
  - Bots often look up their c&c domain name on boot
  - Normal traffic is smoother, people don't all look up the same name
  - Therefore, we can monitor for spikes of lookups for new domains
