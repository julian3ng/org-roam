#+title: Attack Analysis
* Internet Scale Threat Analysis
  Internet wide security scanning: why?
  - Expose new vulns
  - Track adoption of defenses
  - Probe entire addr space with existing tools is slow
* Zmap
  - can scan entire ipv4 space every day
  - 45 minutes to scan 98% of internet at 97% of network speed


  - Arch
    - No per-connection state
    - components async
    - no blocking except for network
    - always send n probes per host instead of trying to retransmist to individuals
    - scan targets that are widely dispersed as fast as possible instead of
      avoiding floods by waiting
    - optimize network stack instead of using off the shelf
* Probes
  - Probe hosts according to random prime group
  - Take random permutation of address space and iterate through it according to group
* Statelessness
  - How? Stick info in mutable packet fields that will have effects on the response
  - ex: hash the target and stick it in appropriate fields like the initial seq
    number
  - Then, the response will have hash + 1, which we can easily decode
* Zmap is better than nmap
  - 1300x faster than aggressive nmap configuration
  - 2 probes to cover entire internet
  - finds more hosts bc zmap doesn't time out hosts on account of statelessness
* Cryptography
  - Don't share keys!!!
  - This happens because of default keys and such
  - Not enough entropy is also bad
    - public key N = p * q
    - factoring N into p * q is bad
    - If we have insufficient entropy, then we could have
    - N1 = p * q1, N2 = p * q2
    - Then, p = GCD(N1, N2) which is trivial to compute, then we've broken the
      keys.
** Embedded systems might be generating broken keys
   - Right after boot there's a period where /dev/urandom is predictable 
* CAs
  - We trust a lot more than we should
  - Lots of CAs give out certs willy nilly
  - Certs are signed with outdated algorithms
