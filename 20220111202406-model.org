* Model
  A model is a representation of reality that picks, adds, emphasizes, and drops
  features to provide a useful tool for testing ideas. For example, consider a
  map. A map is a representation of the world - it picks some area and the most
  important features of it, and may include other useful information that
  doesn't appear directly in reality. Contour lines, latitude and longitude
  lines, and compass directions show up on a map, but not in the world. Using a
  map to navigate is a lot cheaper than having to bumble about in the world as
  well. The map may also have errors like any other model.
