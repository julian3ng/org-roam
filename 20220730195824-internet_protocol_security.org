#+title: Internet Protocol Security
* Internet Infrastructure
  - Has many protocols associated with traffic transport
    - Local and inter-domain routing (BGP)
    - TCP/IP for routing and messaging
    - BGP for routing announcements
    - DNS to find IP from name
* Tiers
  - Tier 1 can reach all networks through peering
  - Tier 2 can reach some networks through peering and purchases access to other
    networks
  - Tier 3 purchases all network access from others
* Protocol stack
  - Application Protocol: HTTP
  - Presentation: Protocol conversion, data encryption, decompression, and their
    inverses.
  - Session: Setup and teardown sessions
  - Transport: TCP/IP - how to get stuff from A to B
  - Network: how to get stuff from one network to the next
  - Link: how to get stuff from node to node
  - Physical: how wires work
* TCP/IP
  - Application message can be broken into many TCP packets that can
    encapsulated with lower layer headers and sent along

  - IP is unreliable and best effort, has no order guarantees
    - Can get to IP gateways, which must know how to get to next network
    - packets have TTL which kills the packet when TTL=0
  - No source IP authentication

  - TCP has CONNECTIONS
    - ordering guaranteed
    - delivery guaranteed
** TCP handshake
   - SYN(SN_c=random, AN_c=0) = hello, here's my first sequence number
   - SYNACK(SN_s=random,AN_s=SN_c+1) = here's my first sequence number, I see yours
   - ACK(SN_c=SN_c+1, AN_c=SN_s+1) =
     here's my next sequence number, I saw your first
** Problems
   - Packets can be compromised by untrusted hosts
   - TCP state can be eavesdropped
   - DOS


   - Example: Attacker sends SYN to server with victim's IP as src
   - Server SYNACKs to victim
   - Attacker sends ACK to server before the victim does
* Other Protocols
  - ARP: address resolution protocol - maps IP addresses to hardware addresses
    for the link layer
  - BGP: spread routing info among ASs
  - OSPF: finds shortest paths internal to an AS
** Problems
   - ARP: can confuse gateway into sending traffic for other hosts.
   - BGP: anyone can send route updates
     - 
** Solutions
   - Add certificates to route advertisements
   - SBGP: sign every hop of a bgp path advertisement
