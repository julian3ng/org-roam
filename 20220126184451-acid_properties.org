#+title: ACID Properties
* ACID
  The ACID properties hold true before and after transactions in a database.

  - A: Atomicity
    - Either an entire transaction happens, or it doesn't happen at all.
  - C: Consistency
    - All constraints, whether inside or outside the database, must hold after a
      transaction. For example, in a banking transfer transaction, the total
      amount of money should be constant before and after the transaction.
  - I: Isolation
    - Multiple transactions should not clash with each other. Transactions
      should resolve in some order instead of interleaving their operations.
  - D: Durability
    - Once complete, the transaction must be written to disk so they survive
      even through system failures.
