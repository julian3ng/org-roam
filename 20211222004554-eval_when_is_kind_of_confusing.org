#+title: Eval-when is kind of confusing
* Eval-when, how work?
  The format is =(eval-when ({situation}*) {form}*)=, with =situation=
  being =:compile-toplevel= / =compile=, =:load-toplevel= / =load=,
  and/or =:execute= / =eval= (The second names are deprecated). The
  entire form evaluates to a result if executed, or =nil= if not.

  When =:compile-toplevel= is used, the form will be evaluated during
  compile time (when =compile-file= is called and a .fasl file is
  generated)

  When =:load-toplevel= is used, the form is evaluated when the .fasl
  file is loaded via =load=.

  When =:execute= is used, the form just acts as =progn=.
