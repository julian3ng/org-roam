#+title: Doman/Network Reputation
* Domain & Network Reputation
** DNSBL
   DNS Black List levels:
   - White: Complete Trust
   - Black: No trust
   - Grey: Not directly spamming but has spam behaviors
   - Yellow: Known to produce both spam and non-spam
   - NoBL: Doesn't send spam but isn't fully trustworthy
** Static Blacklist Model
   - Everyone is innocent until proven guilty
   - Problem: spammers just get new IPs
   - Solution: everyone is suspicious until proven innocent
** Attacker DNS usage
   - Botnets use shortlived DNS domains
   - Spyware uses anonymously registered domains
   - Adware uses disposable domains
** NOTOS
   - dynamically assigns reputations to names
   - uses machine learning to make a scoring function based on network and dns
     zone features of resource provisioning, usages, and management of the
     domains
   - Good accuracy with low FP rate and high TP rate
   - Deployed at large local networks like ISPs (recursive DNS service)
** KOPIS
   - Works at Authoritative/TLD nameservers 
   - extracts features and uses ML to make a scoring function
   - low FP high TP
** Evil domain names
   - features to look for
     - num chars
     - num hyphens
     - num digits
   - High amounts of these tend to be malicious
** Notation
   - RR = resource record = domain + IP
   - 2LD, 3LD = 2nd and 3rd level domain ex) example.come, www.example.com
   - RHIP = related historic IPs: all IPs that have been mapped to domain name
   - RHDN = related historic domain names: all names mapped to an IP
   - ADNT = authoritative domain name tuple: requester, domain name, and RDATA
     (all data about the domain)
** Features
   - Network-based: things relating to network like IPs, ASs, etc.
   - Zone-based: things relating to names like length, char frequency, etc.
   - Evidence-based: things like "has malware connected to this IP"
** Taking down malware
   - Kind of like making a normal attack, just against the malware
   - Enumerate malware
   - Poke it to see what it can do when denied resource access
   - Stop it from doing that
   - Cut off the c&c domain
